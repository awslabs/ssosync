> Helping you populate AWS SSO directly with your Google Apps users

SSO Sync will run on any platform that Go can build for. It is available in the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-1:084703771460:applications/ssosync).

> :warning: there are breaking changes for versions `>= 0.02`

> :warning: `>= 1.0.0-rc.5` groups to do not get deleted in AWS SSO when deleted in the Google Directory, and groups are synced by their email address

> ðŸ¤” we hope to support other providers in the future

## Why?

As per the [AWS SSO](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) Homepage:

> AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) makes it easy to centrally manage access
> to multiple AWS accounts and business applications and provide users
> with single sign-on access to all their assigned accounts and applications
> from one place.

Key part further down:

> With AWS SSO, you can create and manage user identities in AWS SSOâ€™s
>identity store, or easily connect to your existing identity source including
> Microsoft Active Directory and **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**.

AWS SSO can use other Identity Providers as well... such as Google Apps for Domains. Although AWS SSO
supports a subset of the SCIM protocol for populating users, it currently only has support for Azure AD.

This project provides a CLI tool to pull users and groups from Google and push them into AWS SSO.
`ssosync` deals with removing users as well. The heavily commented code provides you with the detail of
what it is going to do.

## Installation

You can `go get github.com/awslabs/ssosync` or grab a Release binary from the release page. The binary
can be used from your local computer, or you can deploy to AWS Lambda to run on a CloudWatch Event
for regular synchronization.

## Configuration

You need a few items of configuration. One side from AWS, and the other
from Google Cloud to allow for API access to each. You should have configured
Google as your Identity Provider for AWS SSO already.

You will need the files produced by these steps for AWS Lambda deployment as well
as locally running the ssosync tool.

### Google

First, you have to setup your API. In the project you want to use go to the [Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and select *API & Services* > *Enable APIs and Services*. Search for *Admin SDK* and *Enable* the API.

You have to perform this [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) to create a service account that you use to sync your users. Save the JSON file you create during the process and rename it to `credentials.json`.

> you can also use the `--google-credentials` parameter to explicitly specify the file with the service credentials. Please, keep this file safe, or store it in the AWS Secrets Manager

In the domain-wide delegation for the Admin API, you have to specify the following scopes for the user.

`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`

Back in the Console go to the Dashboard for the API & Services and select "Enable API and Services".
In the Search box type `Admin` and select the `Admin SDK` option. Click the `Enable` button.

You will have to specify the email address of an admin via `--google-admin` to assume this users role in the Directory.

### AWS

Go to the AWS Single Sign-On console in the region you have set up AWS SSO and select
Settings. Click `Enable automatic provisioning`.

A pop up will appear with URL and the Access Token. The Access Token will only appear
at this stage. You want to copy both of these as a parameter to the `ssosync` command.

Or you specific these as environment variables.

```
SSOSYNC_SCIM_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
SSOSYNC_SCIM_ENDPOINT=<YOUR_ENDPOINT>
```

## Local Usage

Usage:

The default for ssosync is to run through the sync.

```text
A command line tool to enable you to synchronise your Google
Apps (G-Suite) users to AWS Single Sign-on (AWS SSO)
Complete documentation is available at https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync

Usage:
  ssosync [flags]

Flags:
  -t, --access-token string         SCIM Access Token
  -d, --debug                       Enable verbose / debug logging
  -e, --endpoint string             SCIM Endpoint
  -u, --google-admin string         Google Admin Email
  -c, --google-credentials string   set the path to find credentials for Google (default "credentials.json")
  -h, --help                        help for ssosync
      --ignore-groups strings       ignores these groups
      --ignore-users strings        ignores these users
      --include-groups strings      include only these groups
      --log-format string           log format (default "text")
      --log-level string            log level (default "warn")
  -v, --version                     version for ssosync
```

The output of the command when run without 'debug' turned on looks like this:

```
2020-05-26T12:08:14.083+0100	INFO	cmd/root.go:43	Creating the Google and AWS Clients needed

2020-05-26T12:08:15.703+0100	INFO	internal/sync.go:183	Done sync groups
```

You can ignore users to be synced by setting `--ignore-users user1@example.com,user2@example.com` or `SSOSYNC_IGNORE_USERS=user1@example.com,user2@example.com`. Groups are ignored by setting `--ignore-groups group1@example.com,group1@example.com` or `SSOSYNC_IGNORE_GROUPS=group1@example.com,group1@example.com`.

## AWS Lambda Usage

NOTE: Using Lambda may incur costs in your AWS account. Please make sure you have checked
the pricing for AWS Lambda and CloudWatch before continuing.

Running ssosync once means that any changes to your Google directory will not appear in
AWS SSO. To sync. regularly, you can run ssosync via AWS Lambda.

:warning: You find it in the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-1:084703771460:applications/ssosync).

## SAM

You can use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to deploy this to your account.

> Please, install the [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) and [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/).

Specify an Amazon S3 Bucket for the upload with `export S3_BUCKET=<YOUR_BUCKET>`.

Execute `make package` in the console. Which will package and upload the function to the bucket. You can then use the `packaged.yaml` to configure and deploy the stack in [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).
